# CC-statusline

A fast, customizable and themeable status line for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Single Go binary. Works in tmux and doesn't break when you resize your terminal.

## Install

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathabonfim59/cc-statusline/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` by default. Override with `INSTALL_DIR`:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathabonfim59/cc-statusline/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathabonfim59/cc-statusline/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Installs to `$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin` by default. Override with `$env:INSTALL_DIR`:

```powershell
$env:INSTALL_DIR = "C:\tools"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathabonfim59/cc-statusline/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both scripts will print instructions if the install directory is not in your `PATH`.

Or via `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/nathabonfim59/claude-statusline@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathabonfim59/cc-statusline.git
cd cc-statusline
go build -o claude-statusline .
```

Then add it to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.local/bin/claude-statusline"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

Generate a config file with sensible defaults:

```bash
claude-statusline init
```

This creates `~/.config/claude-statusline/config.yaml` (or `%AppData%\claude-statusline\config.yaml` on Windows).

## Configuration

Every field is optional. Missing values fall back to defaults.

```yaml
theme: default

thresholds:
  default:
    warning: 50
    danger: 75

blocks:
  line1: [model, git, project, version]
  line2: [bar, percent, cost, time, tokens, rates, diff, hash]
  compact: [model, bar, percent, cost, git, project, hash, time, tokens, rates, diff, version]
```

Set to a custom name to load `~/.config/claude-statusline/themes/<name>.yaml`.

### Thresholds

As a session grows, the model's context window fills up and response quality degrades: the model starts repeating itself, forgetting earlier instructions, or making mistakes. The progress bar's threshold markers (`|`) and color changes help you spot this before it becomes a problem.

You can set different thresholds per model, since some models degrade sooner than others. Works with any model ID: Claude, GLM, whatever you're using.

```yaml
thresholds:
  default:            # all models
    warning: 50
    danger: 75
  claude-opus-4-7:    # Opus still works well past 50%
    warning: 60
    danger: 80
  GLM-5.1[1m]:        # GLM plan: set tighter if it degrades early
    warning: 40
    danger: 60
```

### Adaptive Layout

The statusline adapts to your terminal width in real time. Resize a tmux pane, shrink a terminal window: the next response automatically reflows to fit. Blocks that don't fit get dropped in the order you define, so you always see what matters most.

You control this through `compact`: it's a priority list. Blocks listed first are the last to be removed when space is tight. Combine it with `line1` and `line2` to decide what shows on each row and in what order:

```yaml
blocks:
  line1: [model, git, project, version]     # top row, full order
  line2: [bar, percent, cost, time, tokens, rates, diff, hash]  # bottom row
  compact: [model, bar, percent, cost, ...] # drop order when narrow
```

Only care about the essentials? Remove blocks entirely:

```yaml
blocks:
  line1: [model, project]
  line2: [bar, percent, cost]
  compact: [model, bar, percent]
```

#### Available blocks

| Block | Line | Description | Preview |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | 1 | Model name, context window size, tokens in use | <!-- screenshot: model block --> |
| `git` | 1 | Branch name with `+N` `~N` `?N` file counts | <!-- screenshot: git block --> |
| `project` | 1 | Project directory name | <!-- screenshot: project block --> |
| `version` | 1 | Claude Code or project version | <!-- screenshot: version block --> |
| `bar` | 2 | Context window progress bar | <!-- screenshot: bar block --> |
| `percent` | 2 | Context usage percentage | <!-- screenshot: percent block --> |
| `cost` | 2 | Session cost in USD | <!-- screenshot: cost block --> |
| `time` | 2 | Elapsed time and API time | <!-- screenshot: time block --> |
| `tokens` | 2 | Token count with cache hit % | <!-- screenshot: tokens block --> |
| `rates` | 2 | Rate limit usage (5h / 7d) | <!-- screenshot: rates block --> |
| `diff` | 2 | Lines added / removed | <!-- screenshot: diff block --> |
| `hash` | 2 | Short git commit hash | <!-- screenshot: hash block --> |

## Theming

Themes define 5 semantic color roles:

| Role | Where it's used |
|---|---|
| `primary` | Model name, section headers |
| `text` | General info (cost, project, tokens) |
| `success` | Git branch, progress bar (low), diff `+` |
| `warning` | Progress bar (medium) |
| `danger` | Progress bar (high), diff `-` |

### Color formats

Each role accepts three formats:

```yaml
primary: cyan             # named ANSI (cyan, green, yellow, red, white, dim, bold)
text: "#ABB2BF"           # hex true color (#RRGGBB)
danger: "\033[38;5;75m"   # raw ANSI escape
```

### Resolution order

1. Local override (`~/.config/claude-statusline/themes/<name>.yaml`)
2. Built-in (compiled-in `themes/*.yaml`)
3. Hard-coded fallback (cyan/white/green/yellow/red)

## Creating a Custom Theme

1. Create a YAML file in `~/.config/claude-statusline/themes/`:

   ```yaml
   name: My Theme
   colors:
     primary: "#FF79C6"
     text: "#F8F8F2"
     success: "#50FA7B"
     warning: "#F1FA8C"
     danger: "#FF5555"
   ```

2. Set `theme` in your config to the filename (without `.yaml`, lowercased):

   ```yaml
   theme: my-theme
   ```

3. Test it:

   ```bash
   echo '{"session_id":"test","model":{"id":"claude-sonnet-4-6","display_name":"Sonnet 4.6"},"cwd":"/tmp/myproject","context_window":{"context_window_size":200000,"used_percentage":42,"current_usage":{"input_tokens":80000,"cache_read_input_tokens":50000,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":3000}},"cost":{"total_cost_usd":1.23,"total_duration_ms":185000,"total_api_duration_ms":120000,"total_lines_added":45,"total_lines_removed":12},"rate_limits":{"five_hour":{"used_percentage":30},"seven_day":{"used_percentage":15}}}' | ./claude-statusline
   ```

You can mix color formats, and only `primary` is required. Missing roles fall back to defaults. Placing a file like `monokai.yaml` in your themes directory overrides the built-in of the same name.
